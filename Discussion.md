Approach 1: Linear Search through the log file
This method iterates over every line in the log file, checking if it starts with the given date.
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of logs.
This is inefficient for very large files (e.g., 1TB logs) as it requires scanning the entire file.
 
Approach 2: Binary Search on the Date
Since logs are chronologically ordered, we can use binary search to quickly locate the first occurrence of the required date.
Steps:
Perform a binary search to find the first line containing the target date.
From this position, sequentially read and extract all logs belonging to the given date.
Stop reading when encountering a log entry with a different date.
Time Complexity: O(log N) for binary search + O(K) for reading K relevant logs.
This method is significantly faster and more scalable.

To efficiently extract logs from a 1 TB log file for a given date, you need a well-structured process. Here’s how you can systematically approach it:


---

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before writing code, set up your workspace:

1. Fork the repository (as per submission guidelines).


2. Create a project directory:

logs_extractor/
├── src/
│   ├── src.js   # Main script
│             
├── output/               # Output folder (logs will be saved here)
├── Discussion.md         # Explanation of approaches
├── README.md             # Instructions to run the script



3. Install dependencies (if any):

pip install argparse tqdm




---

Step 2: Download and Unzip the Log File

Since the log file is 1 TB, direct download may not be feasible for local testing. However:

1. Download the file (only if you need to process it locally):

curl -L -o test_logs.zip "https://limewire.com/d/608b3bd4-c3bf-45c6-abc1-91302035b7e4#ILE27cGoutmcDEpHdV9VqQRvJkC16pq7v1Nx2rzoIl4"


2. Unzip it (assuming it's compressed):

unzip test_logs.zip


3. If the log file is too large for local testing, create a smaller test file with similar formatting.

Step 3: Implement Efficient Log Extraction

Code Implementation (extract_logs.py)

This script will:

Read the file line by line to avoid memory overflow.

Match lines with the given date.

Write matching logs to an output file.





---

Step 4: Optimize for Large File Processing

Since the log file is 1 TB, processing should be optimized:

Optimization Considerations

1. Streaming Line-by-Line:  Already implemented.


2. Using GNU grep for UNIX Systems (Super Fast Alternative):

grep "^2024-12-01" large_log_file.log > output/output_2024-12-01.txt

This is much faster than Python for direct file searches.


3. Indexing and Binary Search for Faster Access:

If the log file is sorted by date, create an index with byte offsets.

Use seek() and readline() to jump directly to the relevant date.





---

Step 5: Document Your Approach

Discussion.md

1. Solutions Considered:

Line-by-line scanning (slow but simple)

Grep (very fast but requires UNIX)

Binary Search with Indexing (fastest but complex)



2. Final Solution Summary:

The chosen approach is line-by-line processing due to its reliability across platforms.



3. Steps to Run:

python extract_logs.py 2024-12-01

OR (if using grep on UNIX):

grep "^2024-12-01" large_log_file.log > output/output_2024-12-01.txt
